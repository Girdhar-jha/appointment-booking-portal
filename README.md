# appointment-booking-portal
[DEMO]{https://appointment-booking-portal.herokuapp.com/}
Here you can book appointments in just 2 minutes.
The website generally has two interfaces one for the admin and the other for the user.
when you press the user button you are directed to a page where you can fill a form to book your appointment once this is done and user presses submit button than it shows 
that you have successfully booked appointment. This was all about user side  of the website.
The next part that is the Admin side , when the person with the internal organistion presses the admin button, then the admin is directed to a page where he can see 
all the recently entered data till now.
on the bottom part of the page you can view verify a user button, on pressing this button you will be directed to a page.
which require 2 input, both input should be from user, the first input is the image of the user who comes for the appointment in a particular slot and second is the 
document that is showed by the user to verify his appointment.
then,the first image is matched by the second document's face if there is a match than the name of both the images will be same and there is a button at the bottom
verified, on pressing that button you will be directed to the page where it shows verified.
I haven't kept any password for the admin page to ease the process.
